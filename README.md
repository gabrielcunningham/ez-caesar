## About
EZ-Caesar is a simple GUI caesar-cipher program written in Java with the Swing graphics library. You can offset the characters in the input by a positive number (encoding) or by a negative number (decoding) to achieve the desired resultant string. Currently only works in English or any other language utilizing the Latin script with no accented characters. This could likely be modified pretty easily to work with other languages more effectively.
